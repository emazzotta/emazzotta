Hi there 👋 my name is Emanuele. I'm passionate about building software. I feel very comfortable working on the back-end but I also love living the DevOps culture and being responsible for the pipeline for code going from localhost to the web. 

What else?
* I love bouldering 🧗‍♀️
* I love indoor skydiving 💨
* I love making coffee ☕️ (Comandante + Aeropress ❤️)
